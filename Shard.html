            <h1>AI Alignment Team Shard</h1>
            <p>I am in the SERI MATS program in the Agent Foundations Stream mentored by John Wentworth. I am the ML Engineer on Team Shard.</p>
            <p>It appears that there is a general consensus that RL seems to be more dangerous than iid training, but its not clear which feature of RL is the
                primary cause of this concern and how far it generalizes to similar approaches.
We are fine tunning a language model to play text adventures with RL and Rejection Sampling and will
                interpret what this optimization process changes in the network with interpretability tools,
                measuring out of distribution behavior and KL divergence. We are designing an optimization procedure which gives process level
                feedback on chains of thought in addition to behavior feedback on the task.
                We will use these experiments to create a theory of value learning in different optimization procedures.
</p>
            <p>Some of the considerations that led into choosing Language Models on text adventure games were: <br>
                Language models understand many human concepts from pretraining.
            We believe that a Large Language Model with some form of Fine Tuning is the route we will take to AGI.
            We wanted a single player game that we could vary from simple to complex as we scale the size of the model.
            We wanted an environment for the model to interact with, and not just a single prompt and response. </p>
            <p>My current progress is making a working implementation of PPO and Rejecion Sampling for Language Models.
                Some of the next steps are to create models trained on text adventure games with RL and Rejection Sampling, and compare the results.
                Run a similar experiment with larger models and chain of thought reasoning on RL and Rejection Sampling.
                Test if the process level feedback creates a more robust understanding of how to do the task in the framework of human reasoning and values.</p>
